# African Business Suite User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan

Plan and checklist for end-to-end testing before release.

---

## Purpose

We are running user acceptance testing to validate African Business Suite end-to-end with real users before rollout. The goal is to confirm that login, onboarding, core workflows, and key modules work as expected across **Studio**, **Shop**, and **Pharmacy** workspaces, and to catch any issues early.

For **tenant-type-specific E2E paths** (retail shop vs restaurant, studio variants, pharmacy, deliveries, public tracking, role checks), see **[`E2E_TESTING_BY_TENANT_TYPE.md`](./E2E_TESTING_BY_TENANT_TYPE.md)**.

## Scope

We are testing:

- **Authentication:** login, logout, invalid login.
- **Signup and onboarding:** new user signup, business type, business info, contact details.
- **Dashboard and navigation:** stats, sidebar, Financial and Resources submenus.
- **Leads and customers:** list, search, create, view details.
- **Business-type-specific flows:** Studio (Jobs, Vendors), Shop (Sales, POS, Shops, Products, Foot Traffic, Vendors), Pharmacy (Sales, Prescriptions, Pharmacies, Drugs, Foot Traffic, Vendors).
