## 🔧 Technical Improvements Needed

### Performance
- ✅ Data fetching optimizations (done)
- ✅ Cache persistence (done)

### UX Enhancements

- ❌ Pull-to-refresh on all lists (some have it, not all)
- ❌ Skeleton loaders (basic loading states exist)
- ❌ Offline queue for sales (not implemented - sales fail offline)

### Missing Mobile Patterns
- ❌ Bottom sheets for forms (using modals - could improve)

- **AI Chat** replaces the need for complex reports on mobile
- The app is **functional for basic operations** but needs more features for full business management
